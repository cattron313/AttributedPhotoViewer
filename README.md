# Slack Coding Challenge

For this challenge, I will be implementing a photo viewer in a grid layout. To enlarge each image, I will create my own UI similar to [Lightbox][http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/].

### Program Setup

Start the program in 3 simple steps!
1.    Run ```npm install```.
2.    Run ```npm start```.
3.    Visit http://localhost:8080.
    *(8080 should be default port but check terminal in case it's different on your machine)*

To run tests run ```npm test``` in the root of your project.

### Approach to Testing

My approach to testing revolves around:
* testing what the core functionality that needs to be delivered (aka what functionality is in the stories or specs)
* gaining an understanding from product (or the rest of the team) what things would be a catastrophe if it broke
* testing the features are difficult to debug
    * For example, I probably wouldn't test whether the top-level component is appended to the DOM since that will be pretty easy to identify.
